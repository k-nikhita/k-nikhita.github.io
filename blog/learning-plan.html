      <h3>Long Term Goal</h3>
       <p>
        My long-term goal is to learn several coding languages well enough, so
        that I can look at real-life problems around me and actually solve them
        them through the creative use of code. For a job/work, I would ideally
        like to be involved with a company that is making a meaningful impact in
        any of the following areas: climate change, public health, arts &
        culture.
      </p>

      <h3>Strengths and Limitations in relation to Learning</h3>
      <p>
        I am incredibly passionate about learning and as mentioned in my
        <a href="identity-values-strengths.html">previous blog</a>, curiosity is
        going to be my fuel on this learning journey. Some of the other
        strengths I have recently developed include the ability to focus on a
        single task and work without distractions.<br>
        <br>My curiosity for learning
        sometimes takes me into deep rabbit holes. And the downside of my
        passion is that I often get into things with a lot of passion, pour
        myself into them and eventually run out of steam.</p>
       <br>
       <h3>Skills I would like to develop while at
        Dev Academy</h3> 
        <p>I want to develop and strengthen my learning habits during
        the course of this program. In addition to that, some of the skills I'd
        like to work on include leadership, problem-solving and big-picture
        thinking.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Biggest Technical Challenge?</h3> 
        <p>No idea.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Biggest Non-Technical Challenge?</h3> 
        <p>Dealing with imposter syndrome and perfectionism.</p>

        <h3>Strategies for Managing Course Workload</h3><br>
        <h4>Working productively:</h4>
        <p>During bootcamp:
          <ul>
            <li>I will aim to stay present and focused in all sessions. I will do this by ensuring that I show up to class well-rested, fed and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I am a morning person, so I will try to use them for any learning I need to catch up with, by waking up early.</li>
            <li>When studying on my own, I will continue to use the practices I did during Foundations, such as aiming to study in 45 minute blocks, without any distractions, using Toggl to track study time, taking breaks to refresh my mind, avoiding procrastination, etc.</li>
            <li>I will delegate more household chores to my husband to ensure that I can maximise study and focus time during the week and use weekends to refresh and reset.</li>
            <li>I will use the check-ins and tech-ins at bootcamp to communicate any struggles/concerns to my facilitators to ensure that I get the support I need instead of wasting time feeling stuck.</li>
            <br>
            <p><strong>A few reminders for myself:</strong>
            <li>Have fun!</li>
            <li>Be present.</li>
            <li>Stay committed to being on top of coursework.</li>
            <li>Make friends!</li>
            <li>Have faith in the learning process.</li>
            <li>Avoid perfectionism and procrastination. "Done is better than perfect!"</li>
            <li>Use weekends to REST & RECHARGE.</li>
            </p>
            <br>
      
       <h4>Dealing with Stress:</h4>
        <p>I find that planning and
        communication are key to dealing with stress. 18 weeks pregnant at the time of updating this plan, I will have a few other baby-related things going on with my body and personal life, that are a bit hard to anticipate at this stage, but I am aiming to communicate closely with the facilitation team at EDA so that there are no surprises. <br><br>
        My plan
        involves starting each day by identifying what the priority for the day
        is. I am fortunate to have a great support system in my husband and
        there are very few tasks that I cannot delegate to him. Some of these
        include checking in with my own needs, looking after myself and studying
        for this course. <br><br>
        If I find myself in a situation where I am struggling
        to cope, I will: <br>
        <ul>
        <li>communicate with my husband, other learners and
        facilitators (the situation will dictate the order)</li>
        <li>focus and act on
        what I can control</li> 
        <li>identify the bare minimum that needs to be done for
        me to move to the next step</li>
        <li>amend and revise my learning plan to get
        me where I need to be! </li></ul></p>
        <br>
        <h4>Seeking Help in a Timely Way:</h4> 
        <p>I will keep an
        eye on how I am tracking with the curriculum and communicate often with the facilitation team.</p><br>
        <h4>Expectations from the Facilitation Team:</h4>
        <p>To support me in my learning in a non-judgmental way
        but also not be afraid to give me open and honest feedback that will
        help me grow. I value and thrive on feedback and get easily demotivated
        by empty words of praise. I am here to learn and improve. </p><br>
        
        <h4>Scheduling Information:</h4> 
        <p>I am currently not working and have no kids (yet). This
        makes it a very ideal time for me to study. I am due with my first baby in June, leaving me plenty of
        time to study from January to March. <br><br>
        Outside of studying, I try to keep
        fit with pole dancing lessons and would really like to be able to keep up with those while still at bootcamp. However, I will try and use the weekends for that to ensure that I am not cramming too much into the week! <br><br>
        I will do my best to do
        most of my studying in the week, leaving the weekends to relax, refresh
        & socialise with friends. However, when things pile up, I won't have any
        qualms putting social & other commitments on hold briefly so I can catch
        up.</p>
