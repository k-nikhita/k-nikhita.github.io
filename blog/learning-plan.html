      <h3>Long Term Goal</h3>
       <p>
        My long-term goal is to learn several coding languages well enough, so
        that I can look at real-life problems around me and actually solve them
        them through the creative use of code. For a job/work, I would ideally
        like to be involved with a company that is making a meaningful impact in
        any of the following areas: climate change, public health, arts &
        culture.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Strengths and Limitations in relation to Learning</h3>
      <p>
        I am incredibly passionate about learning and as mentioned in my
        <a href="identity-values-strengths.html">previous blog</a>, curiosity is
        going to be my fuel on this learning journey. Some of the other
        strengths I have recently developed include the ability to focus on a
        single task and work without distractions.<br>
        <br>My curiosity for learning
        sometimes takes me into deep rabbit holes. And the downside of my
        passion is that I often get into things with a lot of passion, pour
        myself into them and eventually run out of steam.</p>
       <br>
       <h3>Skills I would like to develop while at
        Dev Academy</h3> 
        <p>I want to develop and strengthen my learning habits during
        the course of this program. In addition to that, some of the skills I'd
        like to work on include leadership, problem-solving and big-picture
        thinking.</p>
        <br><hr><br>
        <h3>Strategies for Managing Course Workload</h3><br>
        <h4>Working productively:</h4>
        <p>I am aiming to study from Monday
        to Friday, striving to finish most of the current sprint work by
        Thurday, so that I can use Friday to reflect on my learning, attack the
        stretch material or move on to the material for the next sprint. <br>
        <br>
        I am a morning person, so I try my best to do as much of my learning then.<br><br>
         As
        much as possible, I try to study in 45 minute blocks. I do this by
        starting a timer on my phone for each session and using Toggl on my
        desktop to track overall time. I have a tendency to treat work like a
        marathon, which I have learnt over time is not very effective. Studying
        in 45 minute blocks makes the overall project I am working on less
        daunting, so I am less likely to procrastinate and also allows me to
        take frequent breaks to refresh my mind. <br><br>
        When I study, I do my best to
        keep distractions to a minimum. Some of the things I do include putting
        my phone on silent mode and face down; working on a virtual desktop
        dedicated only to coding work; not checking Slack/social media when in a
        focus session; letting the husband know that I am in "focus mode" and
        not to be disturbed unless it's something urgent. <br><br>
        I start each day and sprint with a rough idea of how many 45 minute blocks it would take me to finish the work cut out for me. And then, I start chipping away at it. Starting this way makes me more mindful of what I want to achieve from a study session, day and sprint overall, and helps me focus better. <br><br> 
        I am a strong
        communicator and good at asking for help when I am stuck. I take
        deadlines seriously and communicate in advance when I foresee not being
        able to meet them.<br><br></p>
       <h4>Dealing with Stress:</h4>
        <p>I find that planning and
        communication are key to dealing with stress. I am currently 11 weeks
        pregnant (Yay! First time mum too!), so I am anticipating that things
        will change a LOT for me in the coming weeks as I deal with all the
        crazy changes happening to my body and ride the hormonal rollercoaster
        of emotions, while managing to keep with the course curriculum. <br><br>
        My plan
        involves starting each day by identifying what the priority for the day
        is. I am fortunate to have a great support system in my husband and
        there are very few tasks that I cannot delegate to him. Some of these
        include checking in with my own needs, looking after myself and studying
        for this course. <br><br>
        If I find myself in a situation where I am struggling
        to cope, I will: <br>
        <ul>
        <li>communicate with my husband, other learners and
        facilitators (the situation will dictate the order)</li>
        <li>focus and act on
        what I can control</li> 
        <li>identify the bare minimum that needs to be done for
        me to move to the next step</li>
        <li>amend and revise my learning plan to get
        me where I need to be! </li></ul></p>
        <br>
        <h4>Seeking Help in a Timely Way:</h4> 
        <p>I will keep an
        eye on how I am tracking with the curriculum and communicate often and
        early with my facilitator, Joseph Quested. By this, I also mean that I
        will NOT leave things to the last minute!</p><br>
        <h4>Expectations from the Facilitation Team:</h4>
        <p>To support me in my learning in a non-judgmental way
        but also not be afraid to give me open and honest feedback that will
        help me grow. I value and thrive on feedback and get easily demotivated
        by empty words of praise. I am here to learn and improve. </p><br>
        
        <h4>Scheduling Information:</h4> 
        <p>I am currently not working and have no kids (yet). This
        makes it a very ideal time for me to study if we ignore the fact that I
        am currently 11 weeks pregnant. I am due in June, leaving me plenty of
        time to study from January to March. <br><br>
        Outside of studying, I try to keep
        fit with pole dancing lessons and would really like to return to those
        once we're out of lockdown. Ideally, I'd like to attend classes 3 times
        a week. However, it is likely that with the study load of the boot camp,
        I might have to put those on hold for 9 weeks. <br><br>
        I will do my best to do
        most of my studying in the week, leaving the weekends to relax, refresh
        & socialise with friends. However, when things pile up, I won't have any
        qualms putting social & other commitments on hold briefly so I can catch
        up.</p>
