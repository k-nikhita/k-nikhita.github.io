        A blog about the things I have learnt about Javascript in the Third
        Sprint of the Foundations Course. November 30, 2021

      <h3>Making sense of HTML, CSS & Javascript: The Anatomy of a Website</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        My favourite analogy to help make sense of the three web languages that
        form the building blocks of most websites is to liken them to a human
        body. A human body has different systems and functions that allow us to
        do what we do and how we interact with our surroundings.
        <br />
        <br />
        As you can see in the image below, HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is
        like the skeleton of the human body. Like the skeleton, it defines the
        content and basic structure of a website - the bare bones. It holds
        everything together and provides a base to hang everything off. However,
        while an HTML only website has all of its body parts, it doesn't look
        like much without its accessories or personal style, nor is it capable
        of moving, speaking or interacting with its surroundings.
        <br />
        <br />
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is the website's clothing and accessories.
        It is responsible for outlining the colours, font and positioning of a
        website's contents, thereby lending it personal style. In the image
        below, you can tell that the girl is a dancer because of her clothing,
        dancing socks and headband (and her pose of course!). CSS is usually
        written in a separate file to HTML but linked to it. Without an HTML
        file to link to, CSS can't do anything as there is nothing to style,
        much like clothing and shoes are useless without a human body to dress.
        <br />
        <img
          src="/images/HTML-CSS-Javascript.png"
          alt="human body with skeleton, muscles and clothes on"
        />
        <br />
        <br />
        HTML and CSS together can help us create well-structured, attractive
        websites but without Javascript, just like the muscles in a human body,
        your websites cannot interact with its users much like a mannequin in a
        store window. Javascript is a programming language that controls the
        behaviour of the website and can be compared to the human body's ability
        to perform actions such as walking or talking (and in the image below:
        dancing), thanks to its muscular (& nervous) system.
      </p>

      <h3>Control Flow</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Control Flow can be defined as the order in which the computer executes
        statements in a script. In Javascript, the computer runs code from top
        to bottom, i.e. it starts from the first line and ends at the last line,
        unless it hits a statement or set of instructions (such as loops,
        conditions or functions) that affect the control flow of the program.
        <br />
        <br />
        This can be likened to writing a script or set of instructions for any
        of the numerous activities that humans undertake every day. Let's take
        going for a walk for example. A basic set of steps involved in
        performing this activity might include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Getting out of bed.</li>
        <li>
          Picking what to wear (Since this will depend on the weather, an
          additional set of instructions based on conditions would apply. Such
          as:
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>If it is not raining, then put on a top and a pair of shorts.</li>
          <li>If it is raining, then add a rain-jacket to your attire.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Put on walking shoes.</li>
        <li>Grab the keys of the house.</li>
        <li>Lock the house.</li>
        <li>Once out of the house, start walking.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        Now the steps outlined above are not exhaustive by any means and may
        vary for each individual depending on many factors such as their
        personal preferences, location, climate, etc. The point I am trying to
        make, however, is that there is a logical order to the steps that one
        would follow and in the case of computer, this order would be top to
        bottom.
        <br />
        <br />
        Humans are creatures of habit. And most habits are automatic, hard to
        break and form a (repetitive) pattern of behaviour that responds to
        certain stimuli. Imagine that we were trying to a build a habit of going
        for a walk each morning for 31 days. In that case, we would end up
        repeating the above set of instructions, <strong>31 times</strong>. This
        is where <strong>loops</strong> come in.
        <br />
        <br />
        Loops in Javascript offer a quick and easy way to do something
        repeatedly. There are many different kinds of loops, but they all
        esentially do the same thing:
        <strong
          >they repeat an action (or set of actions), some number of
          times.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>What the heck is DOM and why should I care?</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        First things first, DOM stands for Document Object Model.
        <br />
        <br />
        Okay, so now what? By now, we know that a website is made up HTML
        elements, attributes, CSS styles, etc. that make up the structure and
        content of a website (or document in the web). Without a structured way
        of representing these building blocks and their relation to each other,
        one can imagine how messy things would get if you were trying to
        manipulate them.
        <br />
        <br />
        This is where <strong>DOM</strong> comes in! The DOM in simple terms is
        a programming interface that defines the logical structure of web
        documents and the way they are accessed and manipulated. In the DOM,
        model, all of the properties, methods, and events available for
        manipulating and creating web pages are organized into
        <strong>objects</strong>; and the structure of these objects is
        represented in the form of a tree.
        <br />
        <br />
        <img
          src="/images/DOM-tree-model.gif"
          alt="The HTML DOM Tree of Objects"
        />
        <br />
        <br />
        It is important to note that unlike HTML, CSS and Javascript, DOM is
        <strong>not</strong> a programming language but instead a web interface
        that allows us to access a document and its elements and even manipulate
        them. To use an analogy, you could see DOM as an
        <strong>interpreter</strong> between HTML and Javascript, in that it
        makes sense of the different languages and provides an interface for
        communication between someone who speaks the language and another that
        doesn't.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can use DOM to for example, change a document's text colour,
        background colour, colour of hyperlinks, etc.

      <h3>Accessing Data from Arrays and Objects</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        An <strong>Array</strong> is a special variable, which can hold more
        than value. You can think of it as a list of items you would like to be
        stored in a single variable. An array can hold many values under a
        single name, and these values can be <strong>accessed</strong> by
        referring to an index number. Javascript arrays are zero-indexed, i.e.
        the first element of an array will always have an index of 0, and the
        last element is at he index value equal to the value of the array's
        length property minus 1.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the example below, the length of the array is 5 but the last element
        [Chips] is at index 4.
        <br />
        <br />
        <img src="/images/array.png" />
        <br />
        <br />
        An <strong>Object</strong> is a variable that contains many values.
        Think of it as storing more information about a certain item. In the
        example above, our array, myList, contained a list of items you might
        want to buy on your next shopping run. An object can be used to store
        more information about each of those items, such as price, quantity,
        etc.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the example below, I have used gingerAle variable as an
        <strong>object</strong> to store information such as name of the item,
        price, quantity, etc. for easy retrieval when I need it. The
        <strong>name:values</strong> pairs in Javascript objects are called
        <strong>properties</strong>. In our example, <strong>price</strong> is a
        property and <strong>5:00</strong> is its value.
        <br />
        <br />
        <img src="/images/object.png" />
        <br />
        <br />
        We can access object properties in two ways:
        <br />
        <br />

        <br />

      <h3>Functions</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        A Javascript function is a block of code that is written to perform a
        particular task. It can be likened to a procedure - a set of statements
        that perform a task. But for a procedure to qualify as a function, it
        should take some input and return an output, based on a some obvious (or
        predefined) relationship between the input and the output. So, to use a
        function, we need to define it somewhere in our code, where we establish
        this relationship between the input and output.
        <br />
        <br />
        When writing a program, there might be several instances where we might
        want to repeat certain tasks without having to specify every single time
        what the code needs to do. This is where functions make life easier.
        <br />
        <br />
        When explaining loops above, I used the example of trying to develop a
        habit to go walking every day. If I was to write a code for a machine to
        do that, I would add the list of instructions to a function such as:
        <br />
        <br />
        <img src="/images/function-walking.png" />
        <br />
        <br />
        Please note that defining a function *does not* execute it. In order to
        do that, we need to **call** the function. In this instance, I would
        invoke or call the walking function that I defined above by writing:
        <br />
        walking ( );
        <br />
        <br />
        Since I am trying to develop a habit of walking each day, I want this
        function to be repeated 31 times in a month. This is where I can use a
        loop to repeat the same function 31 times. This saves me having to write
        the same instructions 31 times and calling the machine to execute them
        that many times.
        <br />
