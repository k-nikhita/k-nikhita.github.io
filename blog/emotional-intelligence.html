    <h5>My thoughts and reflection on Emotional Intelligence. November 30, 2021</h5><br><br>
      <div class="quote">"Anyone can become angry—that is easy. But to be angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way—that is not easy."<br>
       - Aristotle</div><br>
        <br>
        <p>
            At the time of writing this blog, the city of Auckland where I live, has been in lockdown for over a 100 days (!). Never in my life have I witnessed so many people being tested with their mental health and well-being. The COVID-19 pandemic (jeez, it's 2021 now!) has been emotionally devastating for people that have lost loved ones, jobs, health, opportunities and connection; and it has brought to the fore a dire need for us to not just connect with our own emotions but also open ourselves to others' experiences and need for understanding, help and support. Now more than ever, we need to find the time and more importantly, the courage to turn our attention inwards and listen to our emotions and accept them with compassion and without judgement, instead of sweeping them under the rug.
        </p>

            This is where Emotional Intelligence (EI) comes in. EI can be defined as the ability to identify and manage one's emotions as well as those of others [1]. Also referred to as Emotional Quotient (EQ), it is generally said to include a few key skills such as emotional awareness, i.e. the ability to identify and name one's emotions; the ability to harness those emotions and apply them to tasks and challenges; and the ability to manage emotions, which includes both regulating one's own emotions when necessary and also helping others to do the same. When we can manage our emotions, we respond more effectively to situations instead of falling prey to our instinctive response to either, fight, take flight or freeze [2].
        <br>
        <br>
            The term Emotional Intelligence, while having first appeared in 1964, gained popularity after the publication of the book, "Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ.";[3], by Daniel Goleman, in 1995. Funny enough, I had a friend serendipitously recommend that book to me recently and she found it quite amusing that I was going to be blogging about it as part of our Sprint work for Foundations[4]. I haven't read it yet, but the following observations are based on my research on the topic. In the book, Goleman suggested that there is more than one way for a person to be considered smart or intelligent. This is also consistent with the theory of multiple intelligences[5].
        <br>

        <br> 
            While most people think of intelligence as one's Intelligence Quotient (IQ) level, Goleman argued that EQ can be more important than IQ in your overall success in life. IQ is still recognised as an important element of success, particularly when it comes to academic achievement and it seems that people with high IQs typically do well in school, often earn money, and tend to be healthier in general.[6] 
        <br>
        <br>
            However, the concept of IQ in and of itself is too narrow to fully represent the wide range of abilities and knowledge that humans possess! And while I have not researched IQ and EQ well enough to have a definitive opinion on which of the two is superior, the importance of emotional intelligence makes intuitive sense to me based on my life experience so far and the challenges I have faced thus far. 
        <br>
        <br>  
            I have always been quite outgoing and social but I find that in the recent years, I have grown by leaps and bounds just by reflecting on how my emotions influence my decisions and behaviours. I think time was a critical benefactor in this process. I now realise that the more time I spent understanding and questioning why I do things the way I do them, the more it helped me understand not just myself but also develop more empathy for others.
        <br>
        <br> 
            A great side effect of having more patience and compassion for myself is that it has also helped me embrace a growth mindset for pursuits that I had never considered before! Learning to code is just one example of this. The knowledge that making a change is often accompanied by fear, and that that fear can be managed, is what helps me stay motivated even when I find things daunting. This has been a huge driver of fulfillment in both, my personal and professional life. I am often able to take leaps in new directions because I know that I have got what it takes to make a change. 
        <br>
        <br>
            Another advantage is that I find my weaknesses to be areas of improvement. For example, some of the things that I am currently trying to work on in order to improve my emotional intelligence are: listening skills, being less critical of myself, and of others, and being able to say no when I need to.
        <br>
        <br>
            I'd like to conclude by saying that rather than focusing on IQ or EQ, we should recognise that life success is a result of many factors and both IQ & EQ have a role to play in that. We can all benefit from improving skills in multiple areas be it cognitive abilities or social and emotional skills.
