      <h3>Things I have learnt about myself and my ego as a result of the core learning</h3>
       <p>
        I don't think I learnt anything "new" about myself, my ego and the way I learn during the course of these five weeks. However, it did reinforce a few things that I think I will find useful throughout bootcamp, my programming journey, and life. 
        <br>
        These are:
        <ol> 
            <li>I can't just rely on my motivation to do things. Having a plan and developing habits to help me achieve my learning goals are going to be very important for me to sail through bootcamp successfully. This was reinforced by what I have learnt about deliberate practice, neuroplasticity and having a growth mindset.</li>
            <li>Whenever I find myself procrastinating, it's important for me to check in with myself and understand why I am doing so.</li> 
            <li>I am competent enough to do this. Anything that I struggle with in terms of technical content, is just a matter of putting some time and practice into it.</li>
        </ol> 
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Role of Values, Empathy & Self-Awareness in Learning and Programming</h3>
    <p>
        I think values, empathy and self-awareness are important in most things we do! However, values and self-awareness in particular, help guide me in my learning because:
        <ul>
            <li>I am able to use my strengths to help me learn. For example, I know that I am naturally quite eager to learn and I'm also very creative. Hence, I am able to make connections between what I am learning, my past experiences and other things around me.</li>
            <li>I am able to work around my weaknesses. I know that I have a tendency to fall for the perfectionism trap and subsequently, procrastinate, deterring me from my learning goals. However, I have been working on this for a while now and have developed strategies to manage this.</li>
            <li>My values help me stay true to myself and prioritise what is important to me. This is when I know from past experience, I perform my best. I also believe that my focusing on my personal values, I bring something different to the table in terms of diversity.</li>
            <li>Empathy, the ability to understand the feelings of another person is important in most facets of life but especially in the world of programming, because we're writing code to solve real world problems faced by real-world people. Not just that, quite often this will also require working with other people. So the ability to empathise with others is an essential life-skill or quality.</li>
    </p>
    <br>
        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3> 
        <p>To be entirely honest, none of the content in the core learning surprised me because I believe that these are useful life-skills, especially given the rapidly changing environment that we live in! However, I was quite impressed by the emphasis on this learning, and the fact that every sprint had some core skills-related concepts for us to reflect about. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3> 
        <p>I struggled with publishing my blogs on time because I found myself inflating the task in my head, because it needed to be done a "certain" way! That is a BIG reason why I am only getting the time to FINALLY publish this blog just a day before we start bootcamp! Not great, I know. But the fact that when I finally sat down to write about my reflection, it didn't take so long, is a learning in and of itself for me. Sometimes, you just need to put your head down and get to work instead of letting thoughts swim in your head and imagining the perfect time to complete a task "perfectly"!</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Why does EDA spend so much time focusing on core learning?</h3> 
        <p>It makes sense that EDA does that. I have come across MANY people in my personal and professional life that stop learning after a while because they think that it's too late for them! Ironically, I used to think this when I was much younger, but in the last few years, I have made time to understand how I learn and I find that it has helped me challenge a LOT of assumptions I had about what I can or can't do. In addition to learning, there are other soft skills, such as listening, empathy and self-awareness, that are extremely important when working with others. And since programmers hardly work in isolation, it makes sense that we focus on building and improving upon these skills alongside the technical concepts we need to master to become successful programmers.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?</h3> 
        <p>No, I don't consider it a waste of time. I really enjoyed reflecting on the concepts that I already knew and thinking about how I would apply them in my programming journey.</p>
