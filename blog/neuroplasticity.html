      <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
       <p>
        Neuroplasticity, also known as neural plasticity or brain plasticity, is the the ability of neural networks in the brain to change through growth and reorganisation. Simply put, it is our brain's ability to change and adapt as a result of experience.
        <br>
        <br>
        To understand this better, it might first be useful to understand the ten principles of neuroplasticity, outlined by Kleim and Jones[1]. These factors are important because neuroplasticity does not happen in a vacuum and is experience-dependent.
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Use it or lose it: If we fail to drive specific brain functions, we might end up losing corresponding abilities. For example, not putting enough effort to retain and apply knowledge, such as of language or in coding, might mean that you lose that knowledge or skill.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use it and improve it: Training that drives a specific brain function can help in improving abilities. Conversely from above, practicing coding every day will not only solidify existing knowledge but also improve our skill.
          </li>
          <li>
            The nature of the training experience dictates the nature of the change in the brain (plasticity). For example, to become good at coding, it is necessary that I practice coding every day. In fact, to be more specific, if I want to get good at a particular programming language, such as Javascript, then I should be ensuring that I practice JS more often instead of trying to learn several coding-related topics at once.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repetition matters: Change (plasticity) requires sufficient repetition.
          </li>
          <li>
            Intensity matters: Change (plasticity) requires intensive training. The intensity can be built over time as ability improves, and ability improves significantly from intensity of training.
          </li>
          <li>
            Time matters: Different forms of change (plasticity) in the brain happen at different times during training. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Salience matters: Simply put, the training experience should be important, relevant and have meaning to the individual.
          </li>
          <li>
            Age matters: Training-induced change (plasticity) occurs more readily in younger brains, but it doesn't mean change cannot be effected at any age.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transference: Change in function as a result of one training experience can even lead to learning other similar skills. For example, learning one language can help you pick up another language more easily.
          </li>
          <li>
            Interference: Brain changes (plasticity) that result in bad habits can interfere with learning good habits. Learning an easier way might not be the correct way.
          </li>
        </ol>
      <br>
      <p>
        Based on the above principles, I'd like to actively consider doing the following during the rest of the coding course:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Practice coding every day, even on days when it feels hard!
        </li>
        <li>
          Focus on specific languages, such as HTML or Javascript when practicing instead of trying to learn several things at once.
        </li>
        <li>
          Work on improving my focus to ensure that I can handle longer studying times without compromising on quality in terms of understanding and retention.
        </li>
        <li>
          Look for opportunities to work on personal projects wherein I can apply what I am learning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Focus on building good learning habits and break bad habits such as multitasking, procrastinating, perfection, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remind myself of the principles of neuroplasticity often enough, especially when things start to seem daunting and learning feels hard!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>
        A resource that has changed the way I approach learning new things is a wildly popular online course called <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">Learning How to Learn</a>, that I did about a year ago. I cannot recommend this course enough for anyone that is willing to put some efforts to change the way they learn.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Growth Mindset</h3>
      <p>
        A growth mindset is the belief that one can develop their talents through hard work, good strategies and feedback from others; and that you are not born with a set of "fixed" traits, that cannot be changed or improved over time.
        <br>
        <br>
        This is something that I have deeply internalised for a while now, even though I don't have a growth mindset in all areas! Learning to code is one of the most challenging endeavors I have undertaken in my adult life, and I am looking forward to applying what I know to my learning journey. In specific, I will strive to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          when possible, take small steps to tackle a learning challenge instead of putting too much pressure and being over critical of myself.
        </li>
        <li>
          focus on the process, not the end-result, especially when it comes to learning. Instead of obsessing about my skill level, I will strive to put in adequate and frequent practice.
        </li>
        <li>
          focus on stretching my abilities to always learn something new.
        </li>
        <li>
          embrace the "not yet" mentality, i.e. recognise that when I feel frustrated with something I cannot understand or a problem I cannot solve, that it is not a permanent state and that I will eventually get it. 
        </li>        
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>
        I think my current learning plan aligns well with my understanding of neuroplasticity and growth mindset. I am planning to add some of the reflection from above to my learning plan so I can be reminded of these things when I revisit it.
