        <h3>Personal Strengths. Why bother?</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you've attended school and have some work experience under your belt
        that involved job interviews, I am sure you've heard of personal
        strengths (& weaknesses). But I find that with all the messages we're
        bombarded with from social media and a capitalist society that
        constantly pushes the ideals of "hustle culture", it can be quite
        confusing and daunting to look inward and see ourselves for who we
        really are instead of who we are told we should be. This is why, I think
        it is really important to reflect on one's experiences often enough to
        get a sense of the values and the individual strengths that we
        consistently demonstrate in various life situations. <br />
        <br />
        According to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology"
          >Positive Psychology</a
        >,
        <em
          >personal strengths are defined as our built-in capacities for
          particular ways of thinking, feeling and behaving.</em

      <h3>My Character Strengths</h3>
      <br />
      <p>A few months ago, I joined an online course on
      <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>, called
      <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being"
        >"The Science of Well-Being"</a
      >. In the first week of that course, I was required to identify my
      Character Strengths by taking an online test available on the
      <a href="https://www.viacharacter.org/">VIA website</a>. The test
      comprised of 120 questions and took about 30 minutes to complete, at the
      end of which I got a report that gave me a ranking of my 24 strengths. We
      were then asked to take note of our top 5 strengths and use one selected
      strength in a new way, for each day for the following week. <br />
      <br /></p>
      <p>My top 5 "character strengths" according to the VIA assessment are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Curiosity</li>
        <li>Creativity</li>
        <li>Honesty</li>
        <li>Love</li>
        <li>Humour</li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <p>Now, over the years, I have taken several personality tests with
      unsurprising results because I found that most of the assessments seemed
      to be consistent with how I viewed myself at the time. However, I did find
      it interesting that my personal strengths continued to evolve over time as
      I worked different jobs, moved to a different country, made friends from
      different cultures and fell in love with a German guy! What I found really
      cool about the exercise from Coursera was that I was encouraged to look at
      my strengths and apply them differently each day, thereby making me
      realise how <strong>important</strong> it is to for our personal happiness that we
      actively look for opportunities where we can apply our strengths instead
      of getting intimidated my challenges that sometimes test our strengths and
      bring our weaknesses to the fore.</p><br>

      <h3>How My Character Strengths Have Defined Me</h3><br>
      <h4>Curiosity:</h4>
      <p>It has taken me a while to fully embrace that
      curiosity is indeed my biggest strength. In the past, I used think that
      for one to be a curious person, they had to be curious about almost
      everything and that somehow it had to be a trait of only the very smart
      people, thereby disqualifying me. However, in the last 13 months of
      quitting my full time job, I have discovered that I thrive in situations
      where my curiosity is piqued. I am generally very extroverted in nature,
      but I particularly seek and crave the company of people that know things
      that I don't, people that have significantly different life experiences
      for my own and people that can change my views on things. I love getting
      into new hobbies and activities, and generally keep an open mind to things
      I can do with my life. And looking back at the last 15 years of my working
      career, it is this hunger for new experiences that made jump at
      opportunities that my younger self could not have possibly foreseen.<br> 
      <br>
      A year ago, I would have laughed at the idea of learning to code! But over
      the last year, the more I read about the future of work and the lack of
      diversity in the world of tech, the more intrigued I was. It only took ONE
      serendipitous conversation with a friend (who has also studied at <a href="https://devacademy.co.nz/">Dev Academy</a>), for me to rush home and apply for the <a href="https://devacademy.co.nz/course-details/">Web Development Bootcamp</a>! I am in Week 2 of the program and
      love it so much that my brain feels stretched in all the right ways at the
      end of the day. I know that curiosity is going to be my biggest fuel on my
      learning journey at EDA. This also means that I might potentially get
      distracted by something else that is interesting, but to counter that, I
      have been focusing on developing good learning habits such as monotasking,
      timeboxing and staying consistent right from the start. </p><br>
      
      <h4>Creativity:</h4> 
      <p>I used to think that for one to be creative, they had to be good at the arts
      or had to be special or talented in some way. But lately, I have come to
      realise that creativity is more about how you perceive the world around
      you and if you are able to make connections between seemingly unrelated
      phenomena, and come up with solutions. When I look back at all the
      different jobs I have done, hobbies I have pursued (and given up on), the
      people I have made friends with and the ways with which I have overcome
      challenges in my life, I see creativity as a defining trait of my
      personality.<br>
      <br>
      I am enjoying the challenge of building a learning blog SO
      MUCH right now! I look at websites differently now, and think about what
      they might have done to incorporate a specific design/interactive element.
      Each morning when I wake up, my mind is full of ideas and improvements I
      would like to make to this blog and I look forward to putting those in
      action. The downside to that is that I sometimes tend to get into deep
      rabbit holes with design or feature related things but timeboxing really
      helps me get out of that trap! </p><br>
      <h4>Honesty:</h4> 
      <p>I have three values that I hold dearly and use as a guide for my interactions with people and life in
      general: being <strong>authentic,</strong> <strong>open</strong> and <strong>effective</strong>. I can be remarkably good
      at what people call "oversharing" but I truly believe in the power of
      telling honest, authentic stories. I strive to be open with people as much
      as possible because that is what I prize in others.<br>
      I am also very honest with myself and this helps my learning
      pursuits a lot. While perhaps bordering on being over-critical of myself,
      I am quite aware of my lesser strengths when it comes to learning and
      unlearning. I find that sharing openly about them helps me get over them
      rather quickly, and as with many other things in life, that it's just a
      matter of practice!</p><br>
      <h4>Love & Humour:</h4>
      <p>I am your stereotypical
      "happy-go-lucky" kind of girl. I value close connections and love to have
      a good laugh over things. It's a lucky thing to be able to see the light
      side of things, especially in shitty situations.</p><br>

      <h3>How My Culture Has Influenced My Identity</h3><br>
      <p>I grew up in a big family in India, where I lived
      with my parents, younger brother, grandparents, uncle, aunt and cousins
      for a good part of my life. This taught me the values of kindness,
      generosity and adaptability at a very young age. Even though we lived in a
      pretty traditional set-up with rigid gender roles, my mother also worked
      full-time while tending to all the responsibilities that came with being a
      woman in an Indian household. Growing up, she was a huge inspiration to me
      and a symbol of hardcore tenacity with her ability to just get on with
      things, and this has shaped how I see my own strength and potential. For
      many years, I strove to be as strong as her, and worked hard to prove
      myself in my career and personal life. <br>
      <br>My father is a practical man. From
      growing up in a remote, rural village in Northern India to moving to a big
      city like Mumbai for his work and eventually retiring early to return to
      the same village recently, he has been on quite a transformative journey
      himself. The younger me, while petrified of my father's occasional
      outbursts of anger, was quite impressed by his ability to keep calm in
      tense situations that required rational thinking. This is something I took
      on board quite early in my life, and have striven to emulate that ever
      since.
